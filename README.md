# ProtoarcESCWorkaround
  Do you have a Protoarc XK03 bluetooth keyboard and play games? Well, I do. I've noticed that, unfortunately, the ESC key does not only double but triple duty. It acts as the tilde key, the backtick and ESC depending on the combination of keyboard presses you do. If you game on a laptop or the Lenovo Legion Go, like I do, you'll quickly realise that having ESC mapped as anything other than ESC makes it hard to exit some games or even pull up menus (I'm looking at you, Once Human). Well do I have the workaround for you! Strap in, this is going to get slightly wordy and just as slighly difficult. 

What you'll need:

One of those bluetooth wireless keyboards (Using the ProtoArc XK03, https://www.protoarc.com/products/xk03-foldable-keyboard, myself but this method should work with most things)

Microsoft PowerToys (As of this guide, current version is 0.82.1. Check here for your preferred installed method https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install)

I'll preface this set of directions with YMMV, I'm doing this on a Lenovo Legion Go but this should work generally on any Windows 10/11 machine.

First things first, install Microsoft PowerToys as it does all the heavy lifting for this workaround and launch it from the lovely icon that looks like:

Now PowerToys does a lot of pretty freaking amazing things but the section we're looking for to make this workaround happen is called Keyboard Manager. Pick it from the list on the left side of PowerToys.

For Keyboard Manager to do anything, we need to enable it. Slide the toggle to the right and that'll get this party started!
